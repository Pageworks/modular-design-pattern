# The Box
You can't think outside the box you don't have.

# Goals
#### User Focused
Create a framework that handles the minor utilities needed for providing a better experience by transitioning traditional afterthought design decisions to forethoughts.

#### Unify
Provide a basic and simple structure for naming elements and writing scripts with a focus on limiting friction during collaborative projects.

#### Inspire
Provide a flexible foundation that inspires developers to create, innovate, and share.

#### Motion Provides Meaning
Motion focuses attention and maintains continuity, through subtle feedback and coherent transitions. As elements appear on screen, they transform and reorganize the environment, with interactions generating new transformations.

#### Cross-Platform
Projects should be optimized for the best user experience across all platforms. The basic product should maintain the design and feel of the target platform, however, the user interactions, content, and motion should change to work best for the active platform.
