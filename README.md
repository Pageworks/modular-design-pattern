# ðŸ“¦ The Box

At a high level the box is a simple project architecture. It attempts to codify Brad Frost's [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/). The goal of this document is to define a solid foundation for design systems and pattern libraries to be build upon. This document will refrain from presenting examples written in any specific templating engine. Please refer to the [Examples](#) page for detailed examples written with specific CMS and templating engine combinations.

# Terminology

When referring to a **Page** the intention is to refer to a document structure. If a templating engine is used the term Page would refer to the base template that other templates extend.

# Schema

HTTP request is sent to the server.

The server responds with the initial Page. Every Page has a Manager that is instantiated via an [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE). The Page will only include the Styles and Scripts required to run the page.

Styles and Scripts are be packaged independently with a focus on creating small optimized file sizes.

The Manager classes will manage 3rd party packages along with creation, deletion, and management of any classes that are required by the Components on the Page.

A Component's class will manage the functionality scoped to the root node of the Component along with any functionality that the class assigns to Objects and Globals that exist within the Component.

Components **DO NOT** communicate directly with other Components, they will only send information up the hierarchy to the Manager. The Manager is responsible for handling all communication between the Component classes.

# Usage

## Globals

A Global is a unique style for a [Basic HTML Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element). Globals will **NEVER** apply the style to the raw HTML element and they **DO NOT** inherently have any functionality but can be assigned functionality by a Component.

Globals are defined as a single Style file.

### Example Code

File: `Button.scss`

**Correct Usage**

```scss
.g-button{
    border: 2px solid aqua;
    border-radius: 2px;
    padding: 0 16px;
    height: 36px;
    line-height: 36px;

    &.-solid{
        background-color: aqua;
    }
}
```

**Incorrect Usage**

```scss
button{
    border: 2px solid aqua;
    border-radius: 2px;
    padding: 0 16px;
    height: 36px;
    line-height: 36px;
}
```

## Objects

Objects can exists anywhere within the page as visual elements. Objects **DO NOT** inherently have any functionality but can be assigned functionality by a Component.

Objects can be composed of Globals and other Objects.

Objects are defined as a combination of the following files:

1. HTML
1. Style

### Example Code

**HTML**

```html
<div class="o-card">
    <img src="img.jpg" alt="Lorem Ipsume" />
    <h3 class="o-card_heading">Lorem Ipsum</h3>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>
    <a href="page.html" class="g-button">Read More</a>
</div>
```

**Style**

```scss
.o-card{
    width: 256px;
    height: 512px;
    border-radius: 4px;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(41,41,41,0.1);

    img{
        width: 100%;
        height: 128px;
        object-fit: cover;
    }

    .o-card_heading{
        font-size: 24px;
        margin-bottom: 16px;
    }

    p{
        font-size: 16px;
        line-height: 1.618;
    }
}
```

## Components

A Component is similar to an Object except that is has a uniquely defined piece of functionality.

Components can be composed of Objects and Globals.

Components are defined as a combination of following files:

1. HTML
1. Script
1. Style

### Example Code

**HTML**

```html
<div class="c-DemoComponent" data-component="DemoComponent">
    <div class="c-DemoComponent_card"></div>
    <div class="c-DemoComponent_card"></div>
    <div class="c-DemoComponent_card"></div>
    <div class="c-DemoComponent_card"></div>
    <div class="c-DemoComponent_card"></div>
    <div class="c-DemoComponent_card"></div>
</div>
```

**Style**

```scss
.c-DemoComponent{
    display: grid;
    gap: 16px;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;

    .c-DemoComponent_card{
        border-radius: 4px;
        background-color: #ffffff;
        box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(41,41,41,0.1);
        min-height: 256px;
    }
}
```

**Script**

```typescript
export class DemoComponent extends BaseComponent {
    
    public static String COMPONENT_NAME = "DemoComponent";
    
    constructor(el:HTMLElement, uuid:String, manager:ManagerClass){
        super(el, uuid, manager);
    };

    private changeColor:EventListener = ()=>{
        console.log(`Creating a new ${ DemoComponent.MODULE_NAME } module`);
        this.el.style.backgroundColor = 'rgb(66, 134, 244)';
    }

    /**
     * Called when the module is created.
     */
    init():void{
        this.el.addEventListener('click', this.changeColor);
    }

    /**
     * Called when the module is being removed.
     */
    destroy():void{
        super.destroy(DemoComponent.MODULE_NAME);
    }
}
```

## Managers

A Manager is a group of Components that need to work together to perform a tasks that would be too advanced for any single Component to achieve on it's own. The role of a Manager is to manage the Components that are assigned to it along with any additional 3rd party packages.

Managers are defined as a combination of the following files:

1. HTML
1. Script
1. Style

### Example Code

**Script**

```typescript
import { ModuleManager } from 'ModuleManager';
import { Pjax } from '@codewithkyle/pjax';

class Manager{
    constructor(){
        console.log('The Manager has started their shift');
        this.init();
    }

    /**
     * Called when Pjax fires it's custom `pjax:complete` event on the `document`.
     */
    private handlePageLoad:EventListener = ()=>{
        this.reinit();
    }

    private init():void{
        // Start Pjax
        new Pjax({ debug: true });

        // Start the Module Manager
        new ModuleManager();

        // Listen for a successful page transition event
        document.addEventListener('pjax:complete', this.handlePageLoad);
    }

    /**
     * Called when a new page is loaded via Pjax.
     * Any classes/packages that need to manage their DOM hooks should be told to reinit.
     */
    public reinit():void{
        ModuleManager.manageModules();
    }
}
```

# Interfaces

## Manager

```typescript
interface ManagerClass {
    constructor();
    public Function init():void;
    private Function update():void;
    private EventListener reload = update;
}
```

`ManagerClass.init()` is called after the class has been instantiated. It is used to instantiate any utility classes that the Manager will need.

`ManagerClass.update()` is called when the `reload` Event Listener is triggered. It is responsible for updating, managing, or informing any of the Managers utility classes that a page transition occurred.

`reload` is an [Event Listener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener) that fires whenever a page transition occures.

## Base Component

```typescript
interface BaseComponent {
    constructor(el, uuid, manager);
    
    // Variables
    public HTMLElement el;
    public String uuid;
    public ManagerClass manager;

    // Methods
    public Function init():void;
    public Function destroy():void;
}
```

`BaseComponent.el` is the top-level element that the functionality of the Component should be scoped within.

`BaseComponent.uuid` is the [Universally Unique Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) that is assigned to the Component so it can be easily identified by the Manager.

`BaseComponent.manger` is the reference to the Manager that manages the Component.

`BaseComponent.init()` is called after the class has been instantiated. It is used to setup event listeners or call any initial methods.

`BaseComponent.destroy()` is called when the Component is about to be destroyed. It is used to remove any event listeners or call any final methods.

## Component

```typescript
interface Component extends BaseComponent {
    constructor(el:HTMLElement, uuid:String, manager:ManagerClass){
        super(el, uuid, manager);
    };
    
    // Variables
    public static String COMPONENT_NAME;

    // Methods
    Function init():void;
    Function destroy():void;
}
```

`Component.COMPONENT_NAME` is key index value string that the Manager will use to instantiate an new instance of the Component.
