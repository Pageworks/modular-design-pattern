## Project Goals

### User Focused

Create a framework that handles the minor utilities needed for providing a better experience while being conscious of the projects overall data footprint.

### Unify

Provide a basic and simple structure for naming elements and writing scripts with a focus on limiting friction during collaborative projects.

### Inspire

Provide a flexible foundation that inspires developers to create, innovate, and share.

### Motion Provides Meaning

Motion focuses attention and maintains continuity, through subtle feedback and coherent transitions. As elements appear on screen, they transform and reorganize the environment, with interactions generating new transformations.

### Cross-Platform

Projects should be optimized for the best user experience across all platforms. The basic product should retain the design and feel of the target platform, however, the user interactions, content, and motion should change to work best for the active platform.

## Preface

At a high level the box is a fairly simple project framework. It attempts to codify Brad Frost's [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) by building an architecture and tooling to support [Stephen Hay's](https://twitter.com/stephenhay) idea that
